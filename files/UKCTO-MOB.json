      "question": "What is Mobile device refresh policy?",
      "answer": "When selling a solution that uses mobile devices (be that mobile handsets or tablets) there is a risk that the refresh cycle used is too long. Where a refresh cycle is used (to an end client) that is too long the solution will spend time out of support as the majority of vendors will deprecate handsets and tablets within a 2-year period. This principle offers guidance on the refresh cycles for both commercial and industrial mobile devices so that Worldline does not carry an unacceptable risk."

      "question": "Is the mobile market considered as immature market?",
      "answer": "Yes.The mobile market (covering mobile phone handsets and tablets) is an immature market that is evolving considerably faster than the more mature market of windows devices (laptops & desktops). It is not unusual for a provider like Samsung, Lenovo, Sony or Asus to issue a flagship product in one year then supersede it the following year and move to deprecate it within 2 years of launch. Samsung is traditionally quite brutal in this area."

      "question": "did worldline ever faced challenges of maintaining out of date hardware?",
      "answer": "Yes.We have on a number of accounts faced challenges of maintaining out of date hardware, being unable to upgrade a device to a newer operating system and more critically being unable to obtain security patches in a timely manner (or at all) for globally recognised vulnerabilities (BlueBourne, WannaCry, Meltdown, Spectre etc). This has been a significant issue on the consumer devices that have thus far supported our products in the market place."

      "question": "What is a consumer Device?",
      "answer": "A consumer device is a device that is sold mass market to the general public but are also available for use in support of Worldline products & Solutions. A consumer device is generally issued by a provider (Samsung, Lenovo, Sony, Asus etc) and then surpassed by a newer market offering within a year, the provider will normally offer support and patches to the newest device (N) and the previous version (N-1). Once the device you have becomes N-2 (ie is surpassed by 2 devices in the range) the provider will deprecate the model and offer no support of any real value. The provider at this point will lose its desire to support the older models which means no new operating system versions, no new patches and no security fixes."

      "question": "What is the maximum time between refreshes when offering a solution based on a consumer device?",
      "answer": "when offering a solution based on a consumer device the maximum time between refreshes is 2-years for a consumer device. This period can be volatile depending on where the device is in the provider's cycle (N, N-1). The volatility can cause major difficulties with a business case where Worldline is responsible for procuring the device and offering a managed service to the end client."

      "question": "Does the Mobile device refresh policy means we purchase the devices?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How to achieve Mobile device refresh policy on commercial devices?",
      "answer": "1.Recommend to the client that they procure the mobile device to be used based on devices we have tested against (ie what we warrant our software against).\na)if the client isn't prepared to purchase their own devices then recommend the industrial devices (see further down).\ni) if a client isn't open to industrial devices then escalate to the RBU B CTO using the Exceptions request template.\n 2. Offer them suggestions based on the device they choose as to the initial and subsequent refresh cycles.a) the initial refresh may be sooner than 2-years if the device is already in an N-1 situation.\nb) our suggestions cannot be construed as advice or guidance and we must not be responsible for the refresh.\n3. In the contract it needs to be clear that the ownership of the hardware, the software on the device (with the exception of our apps and any MDM we provide) and the availability for upgrades and patches becomes a client responsibility/risk.\n 4. We can offer them an MDM service to the devices the client provides but it needs to be clear that we are simply able to use the MDM software to control configuration of the devices and deploy software that is made available from the providers (or our own apps). It will not be our role to own the relationship with the device providers as we will simply provide upgrades and patches as they become available in the market place."

      "question": "What is the maximum time between refreshes when offering a solution based on a industrialized device?",
      "answer": "Typically a refresh cycle can be around 4-years but the provider will tell you what they are able to offer as each device is normally different."

    {
      "question": "What are industrialized devices?",
      "answer": "An industrialized devices (mobile handset or tablet) is not purchased from a mainstream consumer provider but is offered from a provider that creates the devices for use by people like us offering services (and being responsible for that service. The devices traditionally come with a higher cost than the commercial devices but they have a longer time between refresh as the provider is making the devices to support business not consumers. In addition they are normally more rugged and offer more capability such as ethernet ports."

      "question": "What is the strategy used before selling a solution to client?",
      "answer": "As a strategy we must not become responsible for the hardware, operating system and software of a Consumer mobile (mobile handsets & tablets) device, we should ensure that this responsibility sits with the client. We can offer an MDM service but that solely means we offer the capabilities of the MDM software and the ability to distribute upgrades and patches as provided by the device provider (Samsung, Lenovo, Sony, Asus etc). Where a client will not own this risk/responsibility Worldline will offer the client an Industrialized device as we are able to offer a full service wrap in that manner.."
